### Python Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains various Python projects that demonstrate data analysis, manipulation, and machine learning techniques using libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook or Python script with detailed explanations and code.

## Projects
# 1. Predictive Sales Model
A project that predicts future sales for products in a retail store using a time series forecasting model. The dataset contains daily sales data, and the project involves loading and preprocessing the data, visualizing the time series, decomposing the time series to identify trends and seasonality, training a forecasting model (ARIMA), evaluating the model, and making future predictions.

Technologies Used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scikit-learn
File: predictive_sales_model.py

# 2. Customer Segmentation
A project that performs customer segmentation based on purchase behavior. The dataset includes customer orders with details such as customer ID, order ID, order date, product ID, quantity, and price. The project involves loading and cleaning the data, feature engineering to calculate key metrics (total spend, frequency of purchase), performing clustering analysis using K-Means, and visualizing the clusters.

Technologies Used: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
File: customer_segmentation.py

# 3. Advanced SQL Query Examples
A collection of advanced SQL queries that showcase various techniques such as complex joins, subqueries, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and database manipulation. These queries are useful for demonstrating SQL skills and can be included in a senior data analyst portfolio.

Technologies Used: SQL
File: advanced_sql_queries.sql
